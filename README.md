# Numbers_Generator
* This assignment focuses on generating random numbers using various distributions, analyzing their statistics, and visualizing the results. *
* It contains three scenarios with predefined parameters to write a C program which generates the desired output. 

* The project includes a MAKEFILE compatible for Linux testing as well as random number DATA for testing (.txt files). 

 * -Compile: gcc -o random_generator random_generator.c -lm
 * -OR
 * -Compile using makefile
 * -Execute: ./generator
 *
 * Purpose:
 *This program demonstrates the generation of random numbers using both uniform
 * and normal distributions, including support for:
 * Features:
 * - Generates random numbers to meet criteria for each given scenario. 
 * - Creates and stores .txt files generated into data folder for each scenario.
